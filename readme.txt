Motivation : 
At the end of the month, sometimes no one is sure where his allowances went. 
Noting down daily expenses is in-efficient, and memory doesn't serve well about the expenses of the past days. Similarly, 
people who often go out in groups together find it difficult to track who owes whom and how much. 
Besides knowing spending breakups, corrective measures can be taken to keep a check on our lifestyle to maximize savings.
While there exist applications that provide some features, everyone lags behind in one or the other feature or else they 
increase your expenses to track your expense by charging one time membership fees.

How to host and use:
After installing all dependencies mentioned in the documentation:
1. cd to Sl_proj. You will find a manage.py file over there.
2. run the command 
    python3 manage.py runserver <PORT>
3. go to 127.0.0.1/<PORT> on your browser. You will find yourself on the landing page of the website.
4. Now create a new profile by clicking on Sign Up and entering your details.
5. You can now add Transactions and manage your groups using the button on the navigation bar.
6. You can also view your spending in various domains by looking at the visualization in navbar.
7. You can log out when your work is complete.
